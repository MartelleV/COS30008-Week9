### Memory Management Concepts:
- memory leaks
- dynamic memory allocation
- proper memory management
- Smart pointers.

### 1. Memory Leaks

A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not properly deallocated, leading to wasted memory resources.

#### Example of Memory Leak

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void createMemoryLeak() {
    int* leak = new int(42); // Dynamically allocated memory
    // Memory is not deallocated
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        createMemoryLeak(); // Each call leaks memory
    }
    // The program may consume a lot of memory over time
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to request memory at runtime using `new` and release it using `delete`.

#### Example of Dynamic Memory Allocation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* dynamicArray = new int[5]; // Allocate an array of 5 integers

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        dynamicArray[i] = i * 10; // Initialize the array
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Value at index " << i << ": " << dynamicArray[i] << std::endl;
    }

    delete[] dynamicArray; // Free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Importance of Proper Memory Management

Failing to manage memory properly can lead to issues such as double deletion and dangling pointers.

#### Example of Double Deletion

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Sample {
public:
    Sample() { std::cout << "Sample created." << std::endl; }
    ~Sample() { std::cout << "Sample destroyed." << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Sample* obj = new Sample();
    
    delete obj; // First deletion
    // delete obj; // Uncommenting this line would cause undefined behavior (double deletion)

    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Using Smart Pointers for Better Memory Management

Smart pointers automatically manage memory, reducing the risk of leaks and dangling pointers.

#### Example with `std::unique_ptr`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class SmartSample {
public:
    SmartSample() { std::cout << "SmartSample created." << std::endl; }
    ~SmartSample() { std::cout << "SmartSample destroyed." << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<SmartSample> smartPtr(new SmartSample()); // Automatically managed
    // No need to explicitly delete, it will be deleted when smartPtr goes out of scope

    return 0;
}
```

### Summary of Key Concepts

- **Memory Leaks**: Occur when allocated memory is not freed, leading to resource wastage.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Allows for runtime allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Proper Memory Management**: Essential to avoid issues like double deletion and dangling pointers.
- **Smart Pointers**: Provide automatic memory management, reducing the risk of common errors.
