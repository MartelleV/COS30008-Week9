### Types of Memory:
- static read-write memory
- static read-only memory
- stack memory
- heap memory.

### 1. Static Read-Write Memory

Static variables retain their value between function calls and are allocated in a fixed location in memory.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void incrementCounter() {
    static int counter = 0; // Static variable
    counter++;
    std::cout << "Counter: " << counter << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        incrementCounter(); // Will print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Static Read-Only Memory

Static read-only variables can be declared using the `const` keyword, ensuring that their values cannot be modified after initialization.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Constants {
public:
    static const int MAX_SIZE = 100; // Static read-only variable
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "Max Size: " << Constants::MAX_SIZE << std::endl;
    // Constants::MAX_SIZE = 200; // This would cause a compilation error
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Stack Memory

Stack memory is automatically managed and is used for storing local variables. It has a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void stackFunction() {
    int localVar = 10; // Allocated on the stack
    std::cout << "Local Variable: " << localVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    stackFunction();
    // localVar is not accessible here as it is out of scope
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Heap Memory

Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike stack memory, heap memory must be manually managed (allocated and deallocated).

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* heapVar = new int(42); // Dynamically allocated on the heap
    std::cout << "Heap Variable: " << *heapVar << std::endl;

    delete heapVar; // Freeing the allocated memory
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary of Memory Types

- **Static Read-Write Memory**: Retains its value between function calls and has a fixed location.
- **Static Read-Only Memory**: Defined with `const`, cannot be modified after initialization.
- **Stack Memory**: Automatically managed, used for local variables, and has LIFO structure.
- **Heap Memory**: Dynamically allocated and requires manual management to prevent memory leaks.
